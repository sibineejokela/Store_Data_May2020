# Store Data Analysis

## Background
This repository contains the analysis of a passion project I completed for the start-up I was working for prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. I chose to complete it as I find it rewarding to help small businesses uncover actionable insights. The purpose of this specific project was to use the company's revenue and sales data to derive next steps for the business moving forward (post COVID-19). Additionally, I chose to complete this project in Excel to advance my skills with the tool.

## Workflow
* ### **Step 1. Decide Objectives**
  * Metrics explored include Hourly Sales, as well as Revenue by Store Sections and Products
* ### **Step 2. Obtain Data**
  * Data for this project was extracted from Vend and Shopify, the two point-of-sale softwares used by the company
* ### **Step 3. Prepare Data** 
  * The ERD, created with draw.io, shows the relationship between the tables
  * Data was cleaned and transformed in Excel
* ### **Step 4. Analyze & Interpret Data**
  * Excel was used for pivot tables, charts and other calculations
* ### **Step 5. Communicate Findings**
  * The Project_Summary.md file above contains the graphs, insights and recommendations for the company
  * The data itself is not included in this repository as to protect the financial privacy of the company

## Tools Used
* Excel
* Draw.io
* Photoshop (to redact private information)

## Summary of Findings
You can find the information below at the end of the report. It is included here for easy reference.

**Insights at a Glance**
* *Year-Over-Year growth* was **61% in 2019** (considering June - December) and **48% in 2020** (considering January - February)
* *Highest sales* occured between **12pm - 2pm** and again from **4pm - 6pm** with slight variation between years (2018 - 2020)
* Employees will be likely be least interrupted between 3pm - 4pm and therefore should plan *focus tasks* during this hour.
* Two areas the company could focus on to increase sales without huge increases in cost are the **Focus and Travel sections**
* Product analysis shows the *Time Management* section brings in the most revenue from all product sales. However, when considering only the top five products per section, the *Plants* section brings in the most revenue. These specific products can be found under Objective 4 above.
* The standard **Build-a-Notebook** offering was the *second highest revenue earning product* in 2019 (after general pens).

**Recommended actions at a Glance**
* Double staff the store between 12pm - 2pm on an average day 
* Double staff the store during December and January, and analyze hourly sales data by weekday to determine staffing specifics
* Plan in-store focus time between 3 - 4pm
* Plan advertising campaigns or other additional expenses for the months of March, August and December
* Highlight products from the Focus and Travel sections in-store and/or on social media
  * From the Focus section, start with Manage Your Day-to-Day, The 90 Day Gratitude Journal, and Mindfulness on the Go Cards
  * From the Travel section, start with Casio Watches and Habit Tracker Packs
* Curate online store offerings using the Top Ten Revenue Earning Sections based on the Top Five Revenue Earning Products treemap from above
