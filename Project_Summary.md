## Purpose of the Project
The purpose of this project was to use data collected from the point of sales (POS) of a small start-up in Portland, OR in order to gain business insights the company can use for future growth. The areas explored include sales, store sections, products, and items. 

This project looks at the data for just under the first two years of the company's life. Analysis will provide insight on what actions the company should take around product curation and store sections moving forward. 


## KPIs
* Sales per Square Feet
* Year-Over-Year (YOY) Growth
* Gross Profit vs Net Profit


## Objectives

#### 1. Understand the scope of the data
* How many and which months and years has the company been operating? Which of those provide enough data to address the other objectives of the project?
* How are the sections of the store classified? 
* How do the tables of data analyzed relate to one another?
* What other information is important to understand about the store to gain insight from the data and analysis?

#### 1. Sales
* What is the Year-Over-Year (YOY) Growth of the company?
* What hours of the day are sales the highest and what insight does this provide for staffing? Which hours are most likely to be best for focus time?
* What months should the business focus on advertising and other additional optional costs? (1A)

#### 2. Tag (Section)
* What sections of the store should the business focus on so revenue can increase without having costs increase, thereby leading to larger profit margins?
* How did changing the store layout affect sales for each section of the store, paying specific attention to the Organization section?
* What are the Sales per Square Feet for each section?

#### 3. Product
* What specific products should the business focus on so revenue can increase without having costs increase, thereby leading to larger profit margins?
* How should the business approach product display for different days of the week? (2A)
* 

#### 4. Item
* Which sections are overcrowded with items and which should the business focus on to curate the best choices for customers?
* What is the ideal number of items per section to return the best profit margin?
* Which section can the business expect to have the highest number of visitors and thereby accomodate with appropriate square footage?
* How can the business maximize inventory storage and plan an appropriate amount of space for each section?


## Analysis
#### Objective 1.
In order to understand the data, I have created a data dictionary. A data dictionary provides information on a database including the contents, structure, format and relationship of the elements. Below is the data dictionary for the this project:

Another helpful way to understand the data is with an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD). An ERD shows how the tables (entities) in a database relate to one another. The following ERD was created using the Google Drive diagram editor, draw.io:
